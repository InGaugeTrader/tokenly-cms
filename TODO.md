##General to do list..

* Documentation. For everything.
* Setup Wiki
* Seperate LTB website and theme specific elements from default view files and modules
* Modularize existing "apps"/"modules" better. Ideally, most apps/modules should not rely on anything other than core system modules to function
* Clean out any old/unused code
* Go through all existing code. Fix consistency issues and optimize where possible
* Create a default system theme
